        The spotlight called. You answered. Today, even your reflection is clapping for you.

      <p>
        Confidence is your cologne and you’re spraying it like it’s free. Be proud, be loud, and maybe tone it down just a smidge at brunch.

      <p>
        Someone will try to steal your thunder today — kindly remind them the forecast says “mostly fabulous with a 100% chance of Leo.”

        Your lucky object today is: sunglasses worn indoors.
