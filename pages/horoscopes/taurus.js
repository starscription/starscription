        Today is a perfect day to indulge in something sweet—but not too sweet, just
        like you. Steer clear of drama, unless it’s on Netflix. Your stubborn side

        Lucky snack: Chocolate-covered almonds. <br />
        Vibe check: Cozy but confident. <br />
        Cosmic tip: Take five minutes to sit in silence and just breathe. Or nap. Naps count.
